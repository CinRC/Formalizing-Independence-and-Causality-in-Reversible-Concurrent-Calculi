%%% IRE: independence respects events

% The statement of IRE requires the definition of the relation ~ of equivalence of transitions,
% that relates two transitions if they correspond to the same event.
% We define it here and show that the definition is well-posed.




% Independence respects events (IRE):
% Given three transitions t,t' and u, if t~t' (t and t' are equivalent) and t' and u are independent,
% then also t and u are independent.
